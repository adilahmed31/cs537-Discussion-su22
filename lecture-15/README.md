# Visualization scripts for CS537 - RAID Lecture

- Clone entire folder.
- Run relevant shell script
- When the graphical window opens, use the key `s` to run simulation, `p` to pause and `q` to quit.
- Scripts depend on `python` command being mapped to Python 2.7.18 and not python3. You may need to modify the script to suit your host system.
